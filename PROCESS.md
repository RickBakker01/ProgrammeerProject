# Day 1

I started with creating my map. I listened to the comments of the staff and decided to open the app with a map straight away. The map works for now. 


# Day 2
Map rotates correctly now.
Had a lot of problems with Git. Renske tried to help me. 

# Day 3
Started with a lot of trouble with Git again. First Pieter from my group helped me, seemed to work but didn't. Renske helped me again. It works for now. Hopefully.
