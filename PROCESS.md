# Day 1

I started with creating my map. I listened to the comments of the staff and decided to open the app with a map straight away. The map works for now. 


# Day 2
Map rotates correctly now.
Had a lot of problems with Git. Renske tried to help me. 

# Day 3
Started with a lot of trouble with Git again. First, Pieter from my group helped me, seemed to work but didn't. Renske helped me again. It works for now. Hopefully.

# Day 4
Git still works! (yay)
Started the day with a lot of problems to get to Science Park. After getting there, the roof blew of (really!).
Needed 4.5 to get home... Didn't do a lot today. Fixed some minor issues and made a second asynctask. 
Still need some help with that.
