# Day 1

I started with creating my map. I listened to the comments of the staff and decided to open the app with a map straight away. The map works for now. 

# Day 2
Map rotates correctly now.
Had a lot of problems with Git. Renske tried to help me. 

# Day 3
Started with a lot of trouble with Git again. First, Pieter from my group helped me, seemed to work but didn't. Renske helped me again. It works for now. Hopefully.

# Day 4
Git still works! (yay)
Started the day with a lot of problems to get to Science Park. After getting there, the roof blew of (really!).
Needed 4.5 to get home... Didn't do a lot today. Fixed some minor issues and made a second asynctask. 
Still need some help with that.
 
# Day 5
The map works now. All markers show up. 

# Day 6
Started with InfoActivity. Rough idea is now complete. I said in my README that I would use a SQLite database, but I won't. Firebase is better becuase I can save info online.
Decided to go with Firebase instead.

# Day 7
Made my log in page and my registration page. The work now. Finished the InfoActivity.

# Day 8
Last day of implementing the main functionality. The app can search for breweries now and there is a personal page with info about you and your visited breweries.
Still needs a bit of polishing. But that can be done next week.
