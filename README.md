# Van de kaart


## Purpose
This app will show a map with breweries nearby in the city where the user is. The user can search for cities and see the breweries
in that city. Furthermore, the user can rate a brewery and he or she can save it when he or she is signed in. 
Saving the rating requires an account, which can be made in the app. The rating consists of a 5-star ratingbar and a comment.
